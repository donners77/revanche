Revanche
========

Revanche /rəˈvæntʃ/ (n.) - the policy of a state intent on regaining areas of its original territory that have been lost to other states as a result of war, a treaty signed under duress, etc. *

Revanche is an application built with the original intent of regaining control over the process of character creation and development in fiction writing. It is also useful for the creation and easy editing of any complex heirarchy of objects with many individual properties.

Details about a fictional character are many and varied, but in my own experience, creating a new character tends to fall into an increasingly routine "template". Characters have names. They have hair color. They have a temperament. They have a style of dress. They are associated with a particular writing project. This program is an attempt to resolve the problem of writing endless word processor documents whose first paragraphs begin with things like "Name:", "Hair Color:", "Temperament:", et cetera, when in many cases the there are only a few possible things which can follow.

What Revanche Is
----------------

Revanche is a C# application written using Mono and Gtk#. It loads a framework you define in YAML and displays this framework to you in a nice GUI, allowing you to create and edit objects within said framework. The program is extremely flexible, and basically any tree of objects can be displayed, with whichever editable fields you like, using whatever values you feel necessary.

What Revance Is Not
-------------------

Revanche is not an out-of-the-box solution. To make use of the program, you will need to define your own data structure, with the objects and details you want to see. I have included a few examples of how to do this in a README file in the structures folder; more examples and a skeleton character system will be uploaded in the future.
